# Analysis of Racial Make-up of Pennsylvanian Voters in 2016 Presidential Election

## Background Information 
Over the past few US presidential elections, campaigns have been won based on how candidates reach voters in swing states. These swing states are capable of going to either major political party (Democrat or Republican), which makes them and their respective electoral votes extremely valuable. One of the most commonly mentioned swing states is Pennsylvania, as its 20 electoral votes has a significant influence on the outcome of an election. To convince voters from states like Pennsylvania, candidates often identify specific counties to target with advertisements and candidate rallies. This can also influence how candidates approach specific counties, as they want to highlight specific topics or policies that have significant impacts on different communities. Specifically, racial tensions has been a popular discussion point given the national climate, with both candidates offering claims to appease racial minorities. 

This analysis will investigate the racial make-up of counties in Pennsylvania and determine, using census data from the 2016 election, how candidates should structure their campaigns in the final weeks leading to the 2020 election. In reviewing past election data, we can determine which counties (and demographics in each county) candidates need to target better.
