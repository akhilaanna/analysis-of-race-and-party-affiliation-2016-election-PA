# Analysis of Racial Make-up of Pennsylvanian Voters in 2016 Presidential Election

## Background Information 
Over the past few US presidential elections, campaigns have been won based on how candidates reach voters in swing states. These swing states are capable of going to either major political party (Democrat or Republican), which makes them and their respective electoral votes extremely valuable. One of the most commonly mentioned swing states is Pennsylvania, as its 20 electoral votes has a significant influence on the outcome of an election. To convince voters from states like Pennsylvania, candidates often identify specific counties to target with advertisements and candidate rallies. This can also influence how candidates approach specific counties, as they want to highlight specific topics or policies that have significant impacts on different communities. Specifically, racial tensions has been a popular discussion point given the national climate, with both candidates offering claims to appease racial minorities. (maybe we should put a source for this claim and hyperlink it). 

This analysis will investigate the racial make-up of counties in Pennsylvania and determine, using census data from the 2016 election, how candidates should structure their campaigns in the final weeks leading to the 2020 election. In reviewing past election data, we can determine which counties (and demographics in each county) candidates need to target better and ultimately make an impact on who wins the presidency and leads the country for the next four years. 

## Business Question

As mentioned in the background information, Pennsylvania is one of the states that has significant influence on the outcome of an election due to its number of electoral votes. In campaigning for an election, campaign managers often make data-driven decisions, but time and time again we see candidates still struggling to pinpoint where to focus their attention. For example, for the 2016 election, the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton targeted gaining Philadelphia and Pittsburgh votes rather than rural areas in Pennsylvania, though Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are already very Democratic and was most likely going to vote for Clinton anyway. Her failure to focus her attention on places that actually needed it may have cost her the victory, as suggested by a podcast by *Pod Save America* (about 45 minute mark.)

This leads to the question of: For which counties in Pennsylvania should candidates for each major political party focus their attention of their campaigns for the most success? 

## Data Question 

To answer this business question, we analyzed a public data that listed the percentages of Democrat and Republican votes for each Pennsylvanian county in 2016, as well as the racial demographics for each county. We wanted to include race in our data analysis because if we can determine a correlation between race and a particular political party, that information can also be used for targeting campaigns. 

Our main data question is: What does 2016 election data say about racial make-up and party affiliation of counties in Pennsylvania?

We can break this question down into three parts: 
-Is there a statistically significant correlation
